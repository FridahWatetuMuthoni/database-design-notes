# Databases Notes

## Database Introduction

We use a database management system to manipute data in a database.
We do these using SQL which is a database language that is used to define (data-defination-language:DDL) and (data-manipulation-language:DML) manipulate data.

## Data Defination Language

Data defination language includes defining the columns and the fields of the database.

## Data Manipulation Language

Data manipulation language includes data insertion, update, delete, search etc

## Database Design

What to consider when designing a database:

1. conceptual=>database defination
2. logical=> parent , child relationships
3. physical=> access etc

## Data Integrity

Its basically having the correct data in your database, no broken relationships between tables, duplicate different rows in a database.
Types of data integrity:

1. Entity Integrity => users e.g. caleb etc
2. Referential Integrity => relationships between tables
3. Domain Integrity => when a number's field only contains numbers and not strings.

## Database Terms

1. An Entity is anything we store data about e.g. a user, comments, sales.
2. Attributes. an atribute are the fields in an entity e.g. with a comment entity we have the comment, user who commented it, the comment ID e.t.c.
3. Relation is another name of a table
4. Tuple. a tuple is basically a row in a table.
5. Rows and Columns make up the table
